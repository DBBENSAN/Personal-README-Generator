# Quick ReadMe Generator

## Description 

When creting an open source project on GitHub it is important to have an accompanying README that is high-quality. For this project, I wanted to be able to create these with NodeJS. Through this app, a user should be able to create by using a command-line application. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. By using this app, a README is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

## Learning Points

This project gave me a better understanding on how to use Callbacks and how to use parameters within my functions. Aside from that, I was able to explore the "Inquirer" as an NPM package. One of the biggest learning points for me however, was the use of NPM to include packages and it's dependancies. These clarify to me how I can use other systems and apply them to my work. Throughout the project, there were many points where I felt like I could have improved more or made my code more concise.
